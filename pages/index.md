CSC-151 reference
=================

Welcome to the reference pages for Grinnell's CSC-151, _Functional problem solving_. We started building the new reference pages in early January 2024. Please let Sam Rebelsky know if you'd like documentation for a particular procedure.

For now, it may be best to start with [the list of all documented procedures](../procs/). You may also find it useful to browse [categorized lists of procedures](../categories/).
